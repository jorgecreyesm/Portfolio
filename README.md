Jorge Reyes-Ornelas: Data Analyst & Wine Operations Specialist

Data Analyst | Wine Operations Specialist | BA Sociology & MS Data Analytics Candidate

I am a data enthusiast bridging the gap between industrial operations and sociological insights. With over a decade of experience in the wine industry—spanning both training and operations. I am now leveraging data analytics to solve complex supply chain and consumer behavior challenges.

### The Intersection of My Work

My approach to data is unique because it combines three distinct worlds:

- Domain Expertise: 10+ years in Wine Operations. I don't just see "SKUs"; I see harvest cycles, inventory depletions, and staff training needs.

- Sociological Lens: My background in Sociology allows me to analyze data as a reflection of human behavior, cultural capital, and social trends.

- Technical Rigor: Currently pursuing a Master’s in Data Analytics to apply advanced SQL, Python, and statistical modeling to real-world business problems.
